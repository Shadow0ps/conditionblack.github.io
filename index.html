<p>Condition Black is the place in a fight or combat where you cease to exist. It is in this condition that all cognitive operations cease to register. There is no thinking, no decision-making, no internal dialogue, no reasoning, no regard for safety and importantly, no fear. There is no before. There is no after. There is only now. </p>

<p>This is the state of existence described by the Samurai Warrior as, complete disregard for the self. </p>

<h2 id="whatdoescondition:blackdo">What does Condition:Black do?</h2>

<p>As cybersecurity attacks and real-world (physical) outcomes become intertwined the consequences to life, liberty, and free trade will be affected in the blink of an eye.
